Programming Assignment 4: Library System

Put all java files in a folder named ProgAssignment4. Enter the folder and use command "javac *.java".

After compiling, return to the parent directory and the LibrarySystem.class file using the command "java ProgAssignment4.LibrarySystem".
The Library Data file should be accessible in the child directory for the program to run.
If the file is not accessible, change the argument of the constructor for the Library object to direct the program to the
data file.


If LibrarySystem is not to be used, one should initialize the Library class to a Library object with the constructor being
a String to the file. Then, one should call the runSession() method from the library object with no arguments.
One should also make sure that they manage the package information when running the program.

If the file is not found in both cases, then the program will output a message saying so.
